# simpleCalc
Simple Calculator program using C++
So basically i wrote this whole code in 8 hours. 
I did not watch any tutorials the only one i did was when i was finished and i was checking
to see if i missed anything and thats when i realized i was done.

My past coding exerience isn't too deep i took python for a semester but i didnt really pay attention too much
in class so i dont rememeber much. I was 'learning' C for 2 weeks didnt get past conditionals and loops and 
was planning to make a calc in C but I did some redditing and switched over to C++ cause its
the class i am going to need to take next year so why not get a head start.

Finished up to 1.11 on learncpp.com and went to work just occasionally checking chatgpt to debug but i found myself correcting the AI the whole time so that did not work. 

Now im just yapping so yea.
